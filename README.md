# Filesystem
Filesystem - Laboration 4. Realtid- och Operativsystem.

A Simple simlation af a filesystem, which implements a disk with the size of 250x512B. 
It can create files, directories and subdirecotries and uses our own implementation of the standard unix commands (cs, ls etc).



What need to be done: (Update this regurarly) 
 - Seems to be a bug whenever we "jump up" a level, the pathname isnt updated.
 - reading the tree structure from the file isn't totally perfect. 
 - the format function in the class Filesystem need to be implemented.
